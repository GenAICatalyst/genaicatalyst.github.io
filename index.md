# GenAI Catalyst

## Abstract

In the rapidly evolving landscape of generative artificial intelligence (AI), the efficiency of underlying systems and compilers plays a crucial role in enabling scalable, sustainable, and accessible AI technologies. This tutorial aims to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art techniques in the design and implementation of systems and compilers that optimize the performance of generative AI models, especially for large language models (LLMs). First, we will present Mirage, the first multi-level superoptimization-based tensor program compiler that can help developers to generate fast GPU Kernels without programming in CUDA/Triton. Second, we will present FlexFlow Serve, a distributed runtime system for efficient LLM fine-tuning and serving. We will introduce SpecInfer, the inaugural tree-based speculative inference system, and FlexLLM, a low-cost co-serving system for LLM inference and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Participants will learn about the latest research in AI infrastructure to significantly improve the efficiency of generative AI applications. The tutorial will also feature interactive sessions and hands-on demonstrations, allowing participants to interact directly with the systems and compilers discussed.
